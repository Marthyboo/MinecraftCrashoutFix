Fixes interlude on Minecraft bedrock, Since it's a uwp app, 

- only once does it need to be ran, updating mc should not affect it and you won't need to redo the steps.
- simple to use, just click on "enable debugging" 
- If you want to make it still work after restarting your pc, Click the create task button, That should work for you
- make sure minecraft is open before you open this app otherwise it will NOT work
